Human Intelligence System - HTTP API for Automation
version 2014-07-16 Alpha


What is HIS:

	A Web Interface
		An easy place to copy/paste/upload your source code and
		binaries, into a simple interface. This allows you to
		easily construct "HIS Functions", small atomic pieces
		of automation logic, using the programming language of
		your choice.

	Job Servers
		A fancy "for" loop that executes your source HIS Functions'
		codes and binaries as "jobs".  Special, plain HTTP requests
		to the Web Interface (see above) is how jobs are launched/
		created.
